# First, letâ€™s talk about the Light L. 

There are two types of the L sound: 
-        The light L
-        The dark L
Nevertheless, there is only one IPA symbol for both of them, which is |l|. However, they do sound different.

## I, The light L:
 The Light L comes before a vowel or diphthong in a syllable. For instance: Lot, Loop, Luck, log, lend, lit, lift, fleet, slow,...
  
  We can make the light L in 2 ways.
- Way 1: We raise the tip of our tongue to touch the roof of our mouth.
- Way 2: We raise the tip of our tongue up so that it touches the back of the front teeth.


## II, The dark L:
 The Dark L sound happens after a vowel or a diphthong in a syllable. For instance: Ielts, eel, feel, ill, null,...
 
 There are two parts of the Dark L:
- Part1: the dark sound. 
    - The dark sound is the essential part of the DarkL. Generally, native American speakers stop there and leave out the 2nd part in most cases. You should do the same since it is easier for you to pronounce.
    - To make the dark sound, do not lift the tip of the tongue. Instead, press your tongue down and pull the back of the tongue towards the throat. Bear in mind that when we make the dark sound, we must keep our lips relaxed and feel the vibration in our throat, not our face.
- Part2: the light sound.
     - We only need to include the 2nd part of the Dark L when linking into words starting with another |l| or other sounds with similar tongue positions, such as /s/, /t/, /d/.
