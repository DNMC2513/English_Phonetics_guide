# Intonation


## I, What is intonation?
 Put simply, intonation is the melody of the sentences that you speak, and the sentence stress, which is closely linked to the word stress. In detail, intonation is how you change the variation in pitch throughout individual sentences and all of them while you are speaking. English is **meaningfully stressed**, hence you should pay attention to which words you will raise and lower your voice at to articulate your opinions whilst speaking.
 
> Bear in mind that:
 Syllables within individual words should be stressed in the way that it is supposed to be, in addition to the melody of the whole sentence.


## II, Stress the statements
 For _statements_, such as: "It is hot today.", the pitch _goes lower throughout the whole sentence_. The last word tends to sound softer, lower in volume and pitch than if it comes earlier in the sentence. 
 For instance:
- "I feel so happy today." 
- "Today is a new day". 
The "today" word in the 2nd sentence will sound more stressed and higher in volume and pitch compared to the one in the first sentence.

 However, _content words will be stressed harder_ than function words. _Content words_ are words that convey the main information of the whole sentence or details that you want to emphasize, whilst function words are not. This arrangement is subjective and depends on different speakers. Hence, there is not one right way to stress a statement. As long as the speaker stresses in falling intonation throughout the whole statement, and raises the pitch and volume at their content words, they are doing it right.


### III, The shape of stress:
 Remember that, intonation is not just simply a change in pitch, it is the melody of sentences. Hence, you should not suddenly drop the pitch from a higher level to a lower one. You should include bridging sound to make the pitch smoothly glide between low and high pitch. This can even happen between or within one syllable of a word.
